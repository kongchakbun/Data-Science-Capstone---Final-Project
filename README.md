# Data-Science-Capstone---Final-Project
This repository holds the r codes and data for the final project of the Data Science Capstone course

The project inovloved text mining using data from SwiftKey.  English version of text was downloaded.
After tidying the text documents, we needed to tokenize the documents into bigrams and trigrams.
The tokenization process was a challenge task because of high sparsity of the data.  

Having tried numbers of different R packages and hundreds of hours generating the bigrams and trigrams, we gave up doing so in the laptop.
We deployed the RStudio Server Pro Standard for GCP in the Google Compute Engine and had the tokenization process.
